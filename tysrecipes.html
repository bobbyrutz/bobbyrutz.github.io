                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                
                <p>1 package of bacon <br /> 2 eggs per person <br />
                a little bit of butter <br /> a splash of milk <br /></p>

            </div>

            <div class="tymethod">
                <h1>Bacon</h1>
                <p>Preheat the oven to 400&deg;F. Prepare the baking sheet for the bacon by fitting a sheet of parchment paper over a cookie sheet and opening the bacon package wide. <br /> <br />Place the strips of bacon on the parchment paper close to each other (like they're snuggling) until all of the bacon is on the sheet. Make sure that the bacon is NOT hangong over the edges, crumple or fold the bacon if necessary. <br /><br /> Once the oven is ready, place the baking sheet in the middle of the oven and set the timer for 15 minutes. Check on the bacon after 15 minutes and, it it's not ready, keep setting the timer for 5 more minutes at a time until it's done. <br /><br /> Once it's done, use over mitts to carefully take the bacon out of the oven with BOTH HANDS and place it on the stove top. Get an adult to help you drain the bacon grease from the pan. TURN OFF THE OVEN.</p>

            <div class="tymethod-2">
                <h1>Eggs</h1>
                <p>Place a pan on the stove and turn the element up to 3. Use a spatula to put some butter in the pan and let it melt. In a bowl, crack the eggs holding firmly on one side of the bowl with one hand, and cracking eggs with the other hand by starting from above and cracking downwards. Make sure to pick any shells out of the eggs at this point. Add a splash of milk. <br /><br /> Spread the melted butter all around the pan until it's everywhere. Gently pour the eggs in the pan. Let them cook a bit and then start stirring them around, always pulling the eggs back into the middle of the pan. <br /><br /> When all the eggs look cooked and there are a couple of brown parts, they are ready. TURN OFF THE STOVE ELEMENT. Lift the pan by the handle and scrape the eggs onto a place. Place the pan on another element that is NOT hot.</p>

            <h1>Kraft Dinner</h1>
            
            <div class="tyingredients-2">
                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <p>1 package Kraft Dinner <br /> half a pot of water <br /> a few sprinkles of salt <br /> a big spoon full of butter <br /> 1 cup - milk</p>
            </div>

            <div class="tymethodkd">
                <p>Fill a pot up half way with water. Add a few sprinkles of salt to the water. Turn the stove element on high. Wait for the water to boil. While you're waiting, open the Kraft Dinner package and remove the cheese packet so that you're ready.<br /> <br /> Once the water is boiled, add the noodles to the water and get a big spoon for stirring. Once the water is bubbling with the noodles in it, turn the stove element down to 3. Set the timer for 7 minutes. Stir the noodles, and then continue to stir them every couple of minutes. Use this time to get the butter out of the fridge, measure your milk, and get a strainer out of the cupboard so that you're ready. <br /> <br /> Once the timer goes off, stir the noodles one more time and TURN THE ELEMENT OFF. Lift the pot by the handle in one hand, and hold the strainer in the other hand, and pour the water and noodles completely into the strainer. Put the pot down on an element of the stove that is NOT hot. Once the noodles are drained, put the noodles back into the pot. <br /> <br /> Take a BIG spoonfull of butter and stir into the noodles. Pour the cheese in and stir it around until it's pretty spread out. Pour the milk in and mix it up until it's all even and there are no chunks left. Now it's ready! Scoop your Kraft Dinner into a bowl or eat it directly out of the pot hahahahaha.
